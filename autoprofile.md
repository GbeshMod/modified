## Commands

- **Rotating Profile Picture**
[Syntax: `autopfp <x> <y>`]

  Rotates your profile picture every 60 seconds with x degrees.
  
  x (degrees) - The ammount by which the profile picture should be rotated.
  y (True/1/False/0, case sensitive) - If True, the previous profile picture is deleted from your profile after a new rotated profile picture is generated. Handy for those who don't want to flood their profile with similar pics.
